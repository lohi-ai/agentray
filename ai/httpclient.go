// Timeouts for the chat providers. There are two knobs, they do different jobs,
// and which of them applies depends on whether the request is STREAMED.
//
// Go's http.Client.Timeout is absolute: it covers dialing, the response headers,
// AND the full body read. For a chat provider the body IS the model generating —
// a turn that produces a complete HTML page can legitimately spend minutes
// there. Sizing that cap like a handshake (the old 120s) does not protect
// against a dead gateway; it kills the slowest *healthy* turns, and because the
// kill is deterministic the retry ladder then reproduces it on every attempt.
//
// ResponseHeaderTimeout looks like the safe replacement — time to first response
// header is a real liveness signal — but only on an SSE request. There the
// gateway writes its 200 immediately and the tokens follow, so headers precede
// generation. On a NON-streamed completion the response is a single buffered
// JSON document: headers do not leave the gateway until generation has finished,
// so a "header" deadline is a generation deadline wearing a disguise. Bench #4
// proved it — the first turn generated 9.5k tokens, the header deadline fired at
// exactly 60.3s, and the (successful) retry then spent 135s regenerating the
// same answer: 60s of dead wall clock and a doubled bill for a healthy call.
//
// So: the absolute cap applies to both paths and is sized for the slowest
// legitimate turn; the header deadline applies to the streamed path ONLY.
const (
	// DefaultChatTimeout bounds one chat exchange end to end, body included.
	DefaultChatTimeout = 10 * time.Minute
	// DefaultResponseHeaderTimeout bounds the wait for response headers on a
	// STREAMED request — the "is this gateway alive" check the absolute cap was
	// mistakenly doing. It is meaningless on a buffered completion.
	DefaultResponseHeaderTimeout = 60 * time.Second
)

// NewChatHTTPClient builds the HTTP client for NON-streamed chat completions: a
// generous absolute deadline and no header deadline, because the headers of a
// buffered completion arrive only once the model has finished. A zero timeout
// uses DefaultChatTimeout.
//
// Exported so a caller that knows its own latency envelope can size the cap
// itself and assign it to the provider's HTTP field, rather than inheriting a
// default chosen for the slowest case.

// NewStreamHTTPClient builds the HTTP client for SSE chat requests: the same

// flushes its headers before the first token, so a silent wait past

// stream. The two have opposite fixes, so say which one it was, and for our own
