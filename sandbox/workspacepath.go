// The agent's workspace is ONE directory per conversation, and every tool in
// this package works inside it — file tools, search, shell, computer use,
// browser artifacts, and saved HTTP responses alike.
//
// That single root is the whole point. An agent that can write a script but
// cannot run it, or fetch a file it cannot then read, has two half-capabilities
// instead of one real one. Giving every tool the same root is what makes
// write-then-run, download-then-parse, and screenshot-then-read work without any
// tool knowing about any other.
//
// The layout is
//
//	<base>/<workspaceId>/<projectId>/<agentId>/<conversationId>
//
// which is the ownership chain read left to right: a tenant's workspace, one of
// its projects, one agent in that project, one conversation with that agent.
// Anything wider would let two conversations scribble on each other's files;
// anything narrower would lose the file the user is still talking about between
// turns.

// defaultWorkspaceDirName is the per-user root under $HOME. It mirrors the
// convention of every other tool that keeps per-user state next to the user
// rather than in a system directory, so an operator can find, back up, or delete
// an agent's files without consulting a config file first.

// maxSegmentLen bounds one path component. The ids are UUIDs and slugs today, but
// ConversationID is client-supplied, and a filesystem that rejects a 4KB
// component would surface as a confusing tool error rather than as the bad input
// it is.
const maxSegmentLen = 64

// unnamedSegment stands in for an id the caller does not have. A run with no
// conversation — a schedule firing, a one-shot manual trigger — still needs
// somewhere to put its files, and giving it a stable name means the agent's
// scheduled work accumulates in one predictable place instead of a new directory
// per run that nothing ever cleans up.

// WorkspaceScope identifies the one conversation a workspace belongs to. Every
// field is optional; a missing one becomes unnamedSegment, so a partially
// identified run still gets a usable, stable directory rather than an error.

	// Pinned is a folder the user chose, and it replaces the derived path
	// entirely rather than nesting under it.
	//
	// The derived layout is the right default because it keeps conversations from
	// colliding and needs no decision from anyone. But an agent is often pointed
	// at work that already exists — a repository, a directory of documents — and
	// the answer to "which folder?" is then a folder the user already has, not
	// one AgentRay invented. Pinning is that answer: the same directory across
	// every conversation with this agent, which is also what makes the agent's
	// output somewhere the user can find it.
	//
	// It must be an absolute path (a leading ~ is expanded). Unlike the derived
	// segments it is NOT sanitized into a single component — the whole point is
	// that it names a real place — so it is only ever set from an authenticated
	// operator's configuration, never from anything the model can write.

// tools have nowhere to work, so they are withheld, and the agent a user just
