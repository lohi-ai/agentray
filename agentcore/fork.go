// Forking is core because it is the ONE thing a delegation plugin cannot build
// from the outside: an Agent's capability-bearing fields are unexported, and
// they must stay that way — a child assembled field-by-field from a package
// that cannot see them would inherit whatever the author remembered, which is
// exactly how a child ends up with more scope than its parent.
//
// So the core answers "give me a child of yourself", and a plugin decides
// whether, when, and to whom to delegate. Core owns the inheritance rule;
// the plugin owns the policy.

// Fork builds an ephemeral child Agent for one delegated task.
//
// The child inherits every capability-bearing field verbatim — provider,
// ladder, tools, policy (including the permission gate already installed in
// hooks), memory, definition, limits, env, compaction, retry, caching, output
// cap, and the parent's extensions — so scope can only NARROW, never widen.
//
// It deliberately drops the run-control seams: no durable session, no
// steering/follow-up queues, no step gate, no PrepareNextTurn. A child is one
// bounded task, not a conversation.
//
// childSessionID, when non-empty AND the parent is durable, gives the child a
// durable log of its own and marks it resumable. Callers derive that id
// deterministically from the spawn (parent session + tool call id) so a
// replayed spawn REATTACHES — a completed child returns its recorded answer
// without re-running, and an interrupted one resumes from its own log —
// instead of duplicating the spend and the side effects. Empty leaves the
// child's history purely in memory.
//
// Depth is not a field: it rides the context (see WithDelegationDepth), so a
// cap holds across an A -> B -> A cycle the same as a straight chain.

// where the two agents may be composed with DIFFERENT plugins. So the counter
// rides the context, the loop reads it into RunInfo.Depth, and every extension
// sees the same number.

// delegationDepthKey carries how many delegation hops deep the current run is.

// freshly built Agent whose struct fields know nothing of the caller; ctx is
// the only thread that survives the hop, so it is what stops A→B→A recursion.

// Which agent is making this call?
//
// A spawned sub-agent shares its parent's provider (Fork copies it) and its
// parent's context, so anything decorating the provider — pricing, tracing,
// metering — sees the parent's calls and every descendant's calls arrive
// through the same object, in interleaved order, with nothing to tell them
// apart. A run that delegated three hundred tasks therefore reads back as one
// agent that inexplicably did all of it itself, and the six hundred child calls
// inflate the parent's own turn count.
//
// The run's session id is the natural discriminator: the loop already derives a
// distinct one per child ("<parent session>/<tool call id>"), and it is the same
// key the durable log is written under, so a trace tagged with it lines up with
// the log row for row. Depth (DelegationDepth) says how deep; this says which.
//
// It rides the context for the same reason depth does: a child is a different
// Agent value, and ctx is the only thread that survives the hop.
