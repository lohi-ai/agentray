// Package advisor installs a reviewer over the agent's finished work: at a
// normal finish a second model reads what the run actually did and may leave
// notes, and a note that matters re-opens the run so the agent must resolve it
// before the answer is accepted.
//
// It is the capability finishguard's README lists as its own limitation — "the
// guard sees only passive evidence; it cannot run a check of its own, call a
// tool, or consult a model". The seam is the same (StopInterceptor, consulted
// only on a finish the run chose, bounded by StopInfo.Attempt, injection
// persisted to the durable log like a steer); what changes is that the verdict
// comes from a reviewer rather than a rule.
//
// The kernel and this plugin never learn that the reviewer is a model. It is a
// func supplied by the host, which is what keeps the plugin testable without a
// provider and keeps the model/tier/credential choice where those decisions
// already live.
//
// Ported from oh-my-pi's advisor subsystem. Two deliberate divergences, both
// consequences of reviewing a FINISH rather than a stream of deltas:
//
//   - omp's advisor watches incremental transcript deltas and can interrupt a
//     turn in flight. This one is consulted when the run tries to end, which is
//     the moment "you did not actually check that" is both cheap to say and
//     still actionable, and the only moment at which the work under review is
//     complete enough to review.
//   - omp caps the reviewer at one note per update because it is consulted
//     dozens of times per session. This one is consulted at most MaxRounds
//     times per run, so the per-review budget is about breadth (how much a
//     single injection may say), not about noise over time — see
//     DefaultMaxNotesPerReview.
