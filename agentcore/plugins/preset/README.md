# preset

**Composition, not a capability.** This package has no plugin of its own — it
assembles the others.

`preset.Plugins(cfg)` returns the plugin list that reproduces
`agentcore.New(cfg)`, and `preset_test.go` proves the two agree field by field
via `Describe()`. If the plugin surface ever drifts from `Config`, that test
fails.

`preset.Full(cfg, opts)` is that list **plus** the capabilities `Config` has no
field for: `spill`, `jobs`, `repeat_guard`, `session_query`, plus opt-in todo, subagents, advisor, ask and finish guards. The split is load-bearing — `Plugins` is pinned to
`agentcore.New` parity and must stay a pure mirror of `Config`, so the
capabilities that answer to no `Config` field live one layer up. **`Full` is
where a deployment starts; `Plugins` is where the parity proof lives.**

Every `Options` field degrades to *off*, never to *wrong*. A nil `Spill` leaves
the loop's own head+tail truncation in place rather than minting locators into a
store that dies with the process — the locator is written to the durable session
log, so an in-memory store would make a resumed run read its own spill back as
not-found.

## Model Experience

None. Composition happens before any model call.

## Impact on the agent

It is the starting point for a custom agent. Take the default list, drop or
replace what you want to change, append your own, and build:

```go
ps := preset.Plugins(cfg)
ps = preset.Replace(ps, agentcore.PolicyDenyAll()) // replace the permission policy
ps = append(ps, myCapability{})                  // add a capability
agent, err := agentcore.Build(ps...)
```

The engine owns turn scheduling. Plugins configure capabilities through
registry setters, hooks and per-run extensions; they cannot replace the loop.

Two tests here carry the architectural claims:

- **`TestPluginCompositionMatchesNew`** — the two entry points cannot drift.
- **`TestEjectRemovesEveryTrace`** — building the same agent with and without a
  capability leaves *no sign* of it in the one without: no tool, no name in the
  extension list. This is the test that fails if someone re-couples the loop to
  a plugin by name, because the loop would keep doing the work with the plugin
  gone.

## Known limitations and deferred work

- **Parity is checked through `Describe()`**, so a Config field that `Describe`
  does not report could drift undetected. The test guards against a vacuous pass
  by asserting the dump is not thin, but that is a proxy, not a proof.
- **`Replace` appends.** A replacement lands at the end of the list rather than
  in the original position. Seams are keyed and hooks are prioritized, but extension stop guards
  run in registration order. Preserve that order when replacing guards. Full
  replaces its goal/memory options in place.

Tracing is supplied through `NativeRun.Telemetry` or `telemetry.WithContext`;
there is no observer plugin or provider-decorator registration. Native recovery
validates checkpoints and effect receipts directly.

`Full` additionally accepts `GoalLifecycle` (an opt-in goal plugin configuration),
`AdvisorOptions` (cadence/caps for `NativeAdvisor`), and `ConsolidateMemory` (native
rollout distillation when the configured store implements the optional durable
consolidation contract). Zero values preserve the earlier composition behavior.
