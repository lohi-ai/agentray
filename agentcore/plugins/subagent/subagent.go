// Package subagent installs spawn_subagent: self-forking and cross-agent
// delegation under shared depth and budget caps.
//
// What it buys the parent is CONTEXT, not compute: a child explores in its own
// isolated history and returns only its final answer, so the tool churn, dead
// ends, and large intermediate results never enter the parent's window.
//
// A spawned child is an ordinary governed tool call — same policy gate, same
// credential boundary, same trace — not a privileged side channel. Depth rides
// the context, so an A -> B -> A cycle is bounded by the same MaxDepth as a
// straight chain, and the plugin declines a run already at the cap rather than
// advertising a tool that would only refuse.

// ToolSpawnSubagent is the stable name of the built-in delegation tool
// (ARCHITECT-AGENT-TEAM P1): the model forks an ephemeral child agent for one

// parent's context window.

)

// The default spawn budget SCALES WITH THE RUN, because a fixed number cannot
// be right for both shapes of run this package serves.
//
// A spawn is an ordinary tool call, so MaxToolCalls is already the hard ceiling
// on how many are even reachable; MaxPerRun is the second, tighter bound that
// exists because a child is not a tool call's worth of work but a whole run's.
// Expressing it as a SHARE of the tool budget is what makes it transferable: it
// says "at most a third of this run's actions may be delegation", which is a
// claim about the shape of the run rather than about its length.
//
// At DefaultLimits (24 tool calls) the share reproduces the previous fixed
// default of 8 exactly, so nothing changes for a short run. A long autonomous
// run that authorizes thousands of tool calls gets a proportionate delegation
// budget instead of running out of children on its ninth spawn and being told
// to "finish the remaining work yourself" for the rest of the task — which is
// how a fixed 8 failed: it was calibrated against a 12-turn run and silently
// became a hard stop on delegation for anything longer.
//
// The floor keeps a deliberately tool-starved run (a small MaxToolCalls set for
// some other reason) from losing delegation entirely.
//
// Cost note: the product MaxPerRun × the child's own MaxTurns is what a run can
// ultimately spend, and children inherit the parent's Limits, so raising
// MaxToolCalls raises the ceiling superlinearly. That is why this is a share
// and not simply "unbounded": a consumer that wants a specific number should
// set MaxPerRun explicitly rather than reach it by widening the tool budget.
