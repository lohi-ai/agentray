// Plugin tunes the repeated-tool-call reminder: an advisory
// loop-breaker that watches a run's stream of tool calls, counts runs of
// consecutive calls to the same tool with identical arguments, and injects an
// escalating reminder when the count reaches a configured threshold.
//
// It is NOT a model-facing tool and never blocks: a legitimately repeated call
// is delayed by nothing. The decision — retry differently, gather more evidence,
// or finish — stays entirely with the model. That matters because a real loop is
// indistinguishable from a legitimate retry at the call site; only the model
// knows which it is, so the guard supplies the observation and leaves the
// judgment alone.
//
// This fills a genuine hole. agentcore's existing loop breakers all fire at the
// wrong altitude for this failure: the goal gate catches a verbatim-repeated
// ANSWER, compaction summarizes stale duplicate results away AFTER the fact, and
// the circuit breaker only counts tool FAILURES. A tool that succeeds every time
// and is called with identical arguments twenty turns running — a query the
// model keeps re-issuing because it will not accept the answer — trips none of
// them, and burns the whole turn budget.
