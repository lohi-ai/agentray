// engine as the dashboard). Telling the agent this makes its data answers
// scannable (a table of top novels beats a run-on sentence, a trend line beats a
// wall of numbers) instead of one flat paragraph. Users can extend or override
// this via their AGENTS.md, which is injected above as "Mission & Context".
const responseFormattingGuidance = `# Response formatting
Your replies render as GitHub-flavored markdown. Use it to make data easy to scan:
- Lead with a one-line **key takeaway**, then supporting detail.
- Use ## / ### headings to structure longer answers.
- When you present rows of data (top pages, novels, channels, funnel steps), use a markdown table with a header row, not a run-on sentence or a bare list.
- Use **bold** for the numbers and names that matter.
- When a trend, comparison, or breakdown is the point (a metric over time, top items, a distribution), draw a real chart: emit a ` + "```chart" + ` code fence whose body is a JSON spec. The chart renders with the same engine as the dashboard, so prefer it over describing the shape in prose.
  - Schema: ` + "`{ \"type\": \"line\"|\"area\"|\"bar\"|\"pie\", \"x\": [labels], \"series\": [{ \"name\": \"…\", \"data\": [numbers] }], \"unit\": \"…\" }`" + `. For a pie, omit ` + "`series`" + ` and use ` + "`\"slices\": [{ \"name\": \"…\", \"value\": n }]`" + `. ` + "`x`" + ` and each ` + "`data`" + ` array must be the same length; put real numbers in, not placeholders.
  - Use a chart only when you actually have the data points; never invent values to fill one. A table is fine when the rows matter more than the shape.
- Do not wrap the whole reply in a code fence; prose is markdown already.`

// Injection budget for the recalled-memory block.

// the agent thinks. Nothing bounded it — the store decided what to return and
// prompt assembly wrote all of it — which is the "No relevance budget" gap the
// memory plugin's README named. mnemopi (omp packages/mnemopi) answers this with
// injectionTokenLimit + a per-result content clip; these are the byte-denominated
// equivalents, and they only ever clamp SIZE — the block's wording is unchanged.

// Prompt-cache breakpoint placement. The
// loop, not any single provider, knows which prefixes of a request are stable
// across turns; it expresses that as Message.CacheAnchor marks on the outgoing
// request view, and each provider maps the marks onto its own mechanism
// (Anthropic: explicit cache_control breakpoints) or ignores them (providers
// with implicit prefix caching). New placement policies belong here — never in
// a provider's encode.

// markCacheAnchors returns the request view of msgs with one anchor placed at
// the end of the request's APPEND-ONLY prefix.
//
// A breakpoint tells the provider to store everything up to and including that
// message. The entry is worth something only if it is still a prefix of the next
// turn's request; otherwise the run pays the cache-WRITE premium every turn and
// never reads one back.
//
// The anchor used to go on the final message, which is right for a request that
// is nothing but the conversation — that grows by appending, so the whole of
// turn N is a prefix of turn N+1. It is wrong as soon as a ContextHook appends
// something. A hook's output shapes the request WITHOUT entering persisted
// history (that is the point of the seam: the todo plugin re-renders the live
// plan into every request, retrieval injects fresh context), so the trailer is
// regenerated each turn and sits exactly where the anchor was going. The cached
// prefix then ends inside content guaranteed to differ, and every entry misses.
// Measured on a 300-turn run with the plan pinned: **7 of 299 cache entries were
// still a prefix of the next request**, while 90% of the request bytes were
// unchanged — the reuse was there and the breakpoint was past it.
//
// So the anchor goes at the end of what the loop KNOWS is append-only: the
// persisted history, identified as the common prefix of history and the
// post-hook request. That handles a trailer (anchor lands on the last real
// message) and a hook that rewrites an earlier message (anchor stops before it,
// conservative but re-readable) with the same rule, and needs no state.
//
// The slice (and any anchored element) is copied before marking, so persisted
// history never carries anchors and stale marks from earlier turns can never
// accumulate into more breakpoints than a provider allows.
