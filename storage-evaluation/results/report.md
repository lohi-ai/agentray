# Storage evaluation report

Synthetic local corpus only. This is a decision input for docs/redesign/strategy.md, not a migration and not a production go/no-go. MEASURED rows were executed in this harness; NOT RUN rows are gates that remain open.

## Runs

| engine | scale | readers | days | status | wall_s | load_s |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| clickhouse | 100000 | 1 | 7 | MEASURED | 17.0 | 4.92 |
| duckdb | 100000 | 1 | 7 | MEASURED | 8.2 | 2.26 |

## Correctness

### Semantic gates (target semantics; parity on a limitation is not a pass)

| gate | engine | status | note |
|---|---|---|---|
| currency.mixed | clickhouse | NOT RUN | The Event schema carries only cost_usd Float32 — there is no multi-currency field to evaluate. Mixed-currency billing correctness is untestable in this harness. |
| dedup.read_time_guarantee | clickhouse | NOT RUN | Neither engine applies read-time dedup by default and the harness does not layer one on; the measured raw-vs-distinct gap quantifies exposure but is not a dedup guarantee. |
| entity.tombstone_delete | clickhouse | DIVERGENT | expected 0, got 100. Target semantics: a source delete must remove the row. Current schema has no tombstone, so both engines are expected to show the rows — that is a DIVERGENT gate result, not a pass. |

Latency columns: `first` is the first timed pass after oracle checks (not a true cold read); `repeat` is two further passes. n=1/2 samples are smoke-scale only. Memory is container cgroup usage, not process RSS.

| backup checkpoint + restore + replay | NOT RUN | needs a defined backup/restore procedure to exercise |
| cross-tenant / arbitrary-SQL isolation | NOT RUN | needs the project-isolated sandboxed execution env from strategy.md; this harness's docker-socket driver is trusted tooling, not that sandbox |
| query cancellation under load | NOT RUN | not exercised in this harness |
